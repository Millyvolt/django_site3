# Server Configuration Fix Summary

## 🔧 Problem Identified

The project had a **misconfigured ASGI server setup**:

### ❌ Before:
```
settings.py:        'daphne' in INSTALLED_APPS
requirements.txt:   uvicorn[standard]==0.32.1  (NOT Daphne!)
Result:             ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'daphne'
```

### The Conflict:
- Django was configured to load **Daphne** (in INSTALLED_APPS)
- But **Uvicorn** was installed instead (in requirements.txt)
- **Daphne was NOT installed** → server couldn't start

---

## ✅ Solution Applied

### Fixed `requirements.txt`:

**Removed:**
```python
# ASGI server
uvicorn[standard]==0.32.1
```

**Added:**
```python
# ASGI server for Django Channels
daphne==4.1.2

# Django Channels for WebSocket support
channels==4.2.0
```

### Installed Updates:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Results:**
- ✅ Daphne 4.1.2 installed
- ✅ Channels 4.2.0 installed
- ✅ Server starts successfully with `python run_daphne.py`

---

## 🚀 Current Server Status

### ✅ Working Configuration:

| Component | Status | Version |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| ASGI Server | Daphne | 4.1.2 |
| Channels | Installed | 4.2.0 |
| WebSocket Support | ✅ Working | - |
| Port | 8000 | LISTENING |

### Server Commands:

**✅ Use This (Recommended):**
```bash
python run_daphne.py
```
- Runs Daphne ASGI server
- Full WebSocket support
- Django Channels enabled
- Real-time collaboration works

**❌ Don't Use:**
```bash
python run_uvicorn.py
```
- Uvicorn is no longer installed
- Would cause errors

---

## 📋 Why Daphne?

### Daphne vs Uvicorn:

**Daphne:**
- ✅ Official Django Channels ASGI server
- ✅ Built specifically for Django WebSocket support
- ✅ Maintained by Django team
- ✅ Better integration with Channels
- ✅ Your project was already configured for it

**Uvicorn:**
- ⚠️ FastAPI's default server
- ⚠️ Works with Django, but not official
- ⚠️ Requires different configuration
- ⚠️ Less seamless with Django Channels

---

## 🧪 Verification

### Server is Running:
```
TCP    0.0.0.0:8000           0.0.0.0:0              LISTENING
```

### Test the Y.js Integration:

1. **Open browser:**
   ```
   http://localhost:8000/collab/
   ```

2. **Enter a room name**

3. **Select "Y.js CRDT ⭐"**

4. **Click "Join / Create Room"**

5. **Open multiple tabs** and type simultaneously!

---

## 🎯 Summary

### What Was Wrong:
Your project was configured for **Daphne** but had **Uvicorn** installed instead.

Installed the correct ASGI server (**Daphne**) to match your project configuration.
