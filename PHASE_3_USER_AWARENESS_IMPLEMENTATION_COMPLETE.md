### Message Flow:

**1. User Joins:**
```json
{

    "user_id": 123,
    "username": "john_doe",
    "avatar": "/media/profile_images/..."
}
```

**2. Cursor Update:**
```json
{
    "type": "awareness",
    "data": {
        "cursor": {
            "line": 10,
            "column": 25
        }
    }
}
```

**3. Selection Update:**
```json
{
    "type": "awareness",
    "data": {
        "selection": {
            "startLine": 5,
            "startColumn": 1,
            "endLine": 8,
            "endColumn": 40
        }
    }
}
```

**4. User Leaves:**
```json
{
    "type": "user_left",
    "user_id": 123,
    "username": "john_doe"
}
```

## 🚀 How to Test

### Prerequisites:
- Multiple authenticated users (login required)
- Open the same room in multiple browser tabs/windows

### Test Steps:

1. **Basic Connection:**
   ```
   - Open room in Tab 1 (User A)
   - Open same room in Tab 2 (User B)
   - Both users should appear in user list
   ```

2. **Cursor Tracking:**
   ```
   - In Tab 1: Move cursor around
   - In Tab 2: You should see User A's colored cursor moving
   - Username label should appear above cursor
   ```

3. **Selection Highlighting:**
   ```
   - In Tab 1: Select some text
   - In Tab 2: Selected text should be highlighted in User A's color
   - Highlight should disappear when selection is cleared
   ```

4. **User List:**
   ```
   - Click "👥" button to toggle user list
   - Should show all online users with avatars
   - Current user should be marked "(You)"
   - User count badge should update
   ```

5. **Disconnect Handling:**
   ```
   - Close Tab 1
   - In Tab 2: User A should disappear from list
   - User A's cursor/selection decorations should be removed
   - User count should update
   ```

6. **Multi-User Test:**
   ```
   - Open 3+ tabs with different users
   - Each should have a different color
   - All cursors/selections should be visible simultaneously
   - No conflicts or overlaps
   ```

## 📊 Performance Optimizations

1. **Debouncing:**
   - Cursor updates: 100ms debounce
   - Selection updates: 100ms debounce
   - Prevents excessive WebSocket traffic

2. **Efficient Rendering:**
   - Monaco decorations API (native performance)
   - CSS-based styling (GPU accelerated)
   - Cleanup on user disconnect (no memory leaks)

3. **Smart Updates:**
   - Only sends selection when non-empty
   - Skips echo messages (sender doesn't receive their own updates)
   - Dynamic style injection (minimal DOM manipulation)

---

## 🔒 Security & Authentication

- **Authenticated Users Only:** Only logged-in users can use awareness features
- **User ID Validation:** Server validates user IDs from session
- **Avatar URLs:** Securely fetched from UserProfile model
- **No Anonymous Awareness:** Anonymous users don't broadcast/receive awareness

---

## 📱 Mobile Support

- **Responsive Design:** User panel adapts to mobile screens
- **Touch-Friendly:** Large buttons and touch targets
- **Bottom Sheet:** User list appears as bottom sheet on mobile
- **Optimized Layout:** Cursor labels scaled for mobile readability

2. **Multi-Cursor:** Only tracks primary cursor (Monaco limitation)
3. **Offline Sync:** Awareness state lost on disconnect (by design)
4. **Anonymous Users:** Cannot use awareness features (requires authentication)
