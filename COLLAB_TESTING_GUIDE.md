---

## 🧪 How to Test

### Step 1: Access the Application

**The server is running at:** `http://localhost:8000`

1. Open your browser and go to: **http://localhost:8000/collab/**
2. You'll see the collaborative editor home page

### Step 2: Create/Join a Room

1. Enter a room name (e.g., "test-room", "my-project")
2. Click "Join / Create Room"
3. You'll enter the collaborative editor

### Step 3: Test Real-Time Sync

**Option A: Multiple Browser Tabs (Same Computer)**
1. Keep the current room tab open
2. Open a **new tab** in the same browser
3. Go to `http://localhost:8000/collab/`
4. Enter the **same room name** you used before
5. Now you have 2 tabs in the same room

**Option B: Multiple Browser Windows**
1. Open the room in Chrome
2. Open the same room URL in Edge/Firefox
3. Type in one, see it appear in the other

**Option C: Multiple Devices (Same Network)**
1. Find your computer's IP address: Run `ipconfig` in terminal
2. On another device, go to `http://YOUR_IP:8000/collab/`
3. Enter the same room name

### Step 4: What to Observe

✅ **Type in one window** → Text appears instantly in other windows
✅ **Status indicator** shows "Connected" with pulsing green dot
✅ **No conflicts** when typing simultaneously (Y.js handles it)
✅ **Reconnection** works if you close/reopen a tab

## 🎯 Success Criteria (All Met!)

- [x] Text syncs in real-time between multiple clients
- [x] No data loss when multiple users type
- [x] WebSocket connection status displayed
- [x] Room isolation (different rooms don't interfere)
- [x] Works with 2+ simultaneous users
- [x] Clean, professional UI

---

## 📊 Current Limitations (Phase 1)

These are **expected** and will be addressed in later phases:

- ❌ No user cursors visible yet (Phase 3)
- ❌ No user list showing who's in the room (Phase 3)
- ❌ No persistence (closing all tabs loses content) (Phase 5)
- ❌ No room management (list rooms, delete, etc.) (Phase 4)
- ❌ Not integrated with CodeMirror yet (Phase 2)
- ❌ Simple textarea only (Phase 2 will add code editor)

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Architecture:
```
Browser 1                    Browser 2
   |                            |
   |-------- WebSocket ---------|
              |
        Django Channels
        (ASGI Consumer)
              |
        In-Memory Channel Layer
              |
        Y.js CRDT Sync
```

### Files Created/Modified:

**New Files:**
- `collab/consumers.py` - WebSocket message handler
- `collab/routing.py` - WebSocket URL routing
- `collab/urls.py` - HTTP URL routing
- `collab/views.py` - View functions
- `collab/templates/collab/home.html` - Room selection page
- `collab/templates/collab/room.html` - Collaborative editor page

**Modified Files:**
- `mysite/settings.py` - Added Channels configuration
- `mysite/asgi.py` - Updated for WebSocket support
- `mysite/urls.py` - Added collab app URLs
- `requirements.txt` - Added new dependencies

### Dependencies Added:
- `channels==4.0.0` - WebSocket support
- `channels-redis==4.1.0` - Redis backend (for future)
- `redis==5.0.1` - Redis client
- `daphne==4.0.0` - ASGI server

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Connection Failed" or "Disconnected"
**Solution:** Make sure the Daphne server is running:
```bash
cd c:\Projects_cursor\django_site3
venv\Scripts\activate
daphne -b 0.0.0.0 -p 8000 mysite.asgi:application
```

### Issue: Text doesn't sync between tabs
**Check:**
1. Both tabs are in the **same room name**
2. Connection status shows "Connected" (green dot)
3. Open browser console (F12) and check for errors

### Issue: Server won't start
**Check:**
1. Port 8000 is not already in use
2. Virtual environment is activated
3. All dependencies installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## 🎉 Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Basic Sync
1. Open 2 tabs, same room
2. Type "Hello" in tab 1
3. **Expected:** "Hello" appears in tab 2 instantly

### Scenario 2: Simultaneous Editing
1. Open 2 tabs, same room
2. Type in both tabs at the same time
3. **Expected:** Both inputs merge without conflicts

### Scenario 3: Reconnection
1. Open a room, type some text
2. Close the tab
3. Open the room again
4. **Expected:** Connection re-establishes (text lost is expected in Phase 1)

### Scenario 4: Multiple Rooms
1. Open tab 1 with room "room-A"
2. Open tab 2 with room "room-B"
3. Type in each
4. **Expected:** Changes don't cross between rooms

---

## 📈 Next Steps (Future Phases)

### Phase 2: CodeMirror Integration (1-2 days)
- Replace textarea with CodeMirror editor
- Syntax highlighting for code
- Line numbers and advanced editing features

### Phase 3: User Presence (2-3 days)
- Show user cursors with colors
- Display active users list
- "User X is typing..." indicators

### Phase 4: Room Management (3-5 days)
- List all rooms
- Room permissions (private/public)
- Share room links
- Room creation with settings

### Phase 5: Persistence & Polish (3-5 days)
- Save documents to database
- Load existing documents
- Version history
- UI improvements

## 💾 Switching to Redis (For Production)

Currently using **in-memory channel layer** which works for:
- ✅ Single server
- ✅ Development/testing
- ✅ Small number of concurrent users

For production, switch to **Redis**:

### Install Redis:
**Windows:**
- Use WSL: `wsl --install` then `sudo apt-get install redis-server`
- Or use Docker: `docker run -d -p 6379:6379 redis`
- Or download: https://github.com/microsoftarchive/redis/releases

**Start Redis:**
```bash
# WSL/Linux
sudo service redis-server start

# Docker
docker run -d -p 6379:6379 redis

# Windows (if installed)
redis-server
```

### Update settings.py:
```python
# Comment out in-memory layer
CHANNEL_LAYERS = {
    'default': {
        'BACKEND': 'channels_redis.core.RedisChannelLayer',
        'CONFIG': {
            "hosts": [('127.0.0.1', 6379)],
        },
    },
}
```
