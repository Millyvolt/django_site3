## 🐛 Debugging

### Check Console Logs

**Simple Sync Mode:**
```javascript
✓ Initializing Simple Sync mode...
✓ WebSocket connected (Simple Sync)
✓ Sent update to server
✓ Received update from server
```

**Y-Monaco Sync Mode:**
```javascript
✓ Y.js libraries loaded
✓ Initializing Y-Monaco Sync mode...
✓ Y-Monaco WebSocket connected
✓ Y-Monaco binding created
✓ Sent Y.js update to server
✓ Applied Y.js update from server
```

### Check Network Tab

**Simple Sync:**
- Look for WebSocket connection
- Messages should be JSON text
- Example: `{"text": "...", "language": "cpp"}`

**Y-Monaco:**
- Look for WebSocket connection
- Messages should be binary (ArrayBuffer)
- Example: `[Binary Message] 234 bytes`

### Check Developer Console

Access Y.js objects:
```javascript
// Check if Y.js loaded
window.yjs_loaded

// Check sync mode
currentSyncMode

// Check Y.js objects (Y-Monaco mode only)
window.ydoc         // Y.js document
window.ytext        // Shared text
window.yMonacoBinding // Monaco binding

// Check editor
window.monacoEditor // Monaco instance
```

### Common Issues

**Issue 1: Toggle doesn't switch**
- Solution: Refresh page after toggling
- Mode changes require full page reload

**Issue 2: Y.js not loading**
- Check console for errors
- Verify CDN is accessible
- Check internet connection
- Should fallback to Simple Sync automatically

**Issue 3: Users panel empty**
- This is expected for Simple Sync mode
- Shows only local user currently
- Full multi-user awareness requires Y-Monaco mode

**Issue 4: No synchronization**
- Check WebSocket connection status
- Look for connection errors in console
- Verify Django server is running
- Check firewall/network settings
